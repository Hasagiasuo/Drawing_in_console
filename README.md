#Welcome to the console drawing programme!

##To get started, issue the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/Hasagiasuo/Drawing_in_console
cd target/debug
./draw_console
```

###You will then be able to draw in your console! At the bottom of the screen, you will see a list of available colours and on the right the selected colour! 



#Good luck =)
